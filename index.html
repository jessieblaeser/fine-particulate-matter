        <h1>Where countries are making gains and losses in mean exposure to fine particulate matter</h1>
        <h3>As the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency prepares to adjust exposure thresholds for air pollutants, this map shows countries’ changes in PM2.5 concentrations from 1990 to 2019.</h3>

        <p>“Fine particulate matter,” “PM 2.5,” “soot,” or just plain, old “air pollution” occurs when pollutant particles themselves are 2.5 microns or smaller. While they may be small, these particles affect more people around the world than any other pollutant, and pose “the greatest risk” to global health, according to the <a href="https://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?DataSetCode=EXP_PM2_5#">Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development</a>.</p>
        <p>The U.S.-based Environmental Protection Agency is preparing a report that could cut daily exposure limits to fine particulate matter from 35 micrograms per cubic meter to 30 or 25, according to <a href="https://www.eenews.net/articles/epa-staff-no-need-to-tighten-soot-limits/">E&E News</a>. The report could arrive as early as this summer, says the <a href="https://www.sej.org/publications/tipsheet/fine-particle-pollution-will-soon-spawn-stormcloud-news">Society for Environmental Journalists.</a></p>
        <p>In addition to daily exposure limits, the EPA also offers standards for mean annual exposure: between <a href="https://www.epa.gov/pm-pollution/national-ambient-air-quality-standards-naaqs-pm">12 and 15 micrograms per cubic meter</a>. While the U.S. fell within that range in 2019, mean annual exposure to PM2.5 across the globe was 42.5 in 2019, according to OECD data.</p>
        <p>Mean annual exposure obscures daily risk, as well as local risks. This map should not be used as a measure of “good” versus “bad” exposure levels — such assessments are better suited for real-time data, which can be found here in <a href="https://www.unep.org/explore-topics/air/what-we-do/monitoring-air-quality/urban-air-action-platform">live map</a> updated by the U.N. — rather, it reflects the general trajectory of countries’ overall emission of soot by showing the percent change in PM2.5 micrograms per cubic meter each has seen from 1990 to 2019. You can click on each country below to see its specific percent increase or decrease, as well as its ranking among the world for PM2.5 emissions as of 2019.</p>
        <h2>Bolivia has made the most progress in reducing mean PM2.5 concentrations over the last three decades</h2>

            <p>Some countries with the greatest improvement still have relatively lower readings of PM2.5 when compared to others. For example, the U.S. saw quite a significant reduction in PM2.5 emissions between 1990 and 2019, nearly a 50 percent decrease. But the United States’ PM2.5 emissions were already low in 1990 relative to the globe; it moved from 13 micrograms of PM2.5 per cubic meter to 7 in 2019, ranking sixth in the world for lowest emissions, behind Sweeden, Estonia, Norway, Iceland and Canada.</p>
            <p>Bolivia, on the other hand, shows a fairly similar decrease in emissions, just under 50 percent across the three-decade period. But Bolivia’s reduction in PM2.5 far outpaces the United States, moving from 51 micrograms per cubic meter in 1990 to 27 in 2019.</p>
            <p>Meanwhile, while China shows a slight improvement in mean exposure to PM2.5, it ranks fifth in the world for the percent of premature deaths attributed to fine particulate matter, measured annually per 1000 people, according to OECD data. Roughly one-fifth of premature deaths in the country were attributed to complications caused by exposure to fine particulate matter in 2019.</p>
            <p>Egypt, Kuwait, Bahrain and Iraq attributed even greater shares of premature deaths to fine particulate matter than China, with Egypt estimating just over one fourth of its premature deaths were due to exposure in 2019.</p>
            <p>Take a look at the map below to see which countries had the highest mean annual concentrations of PM2.5 in 2019.</p>
            <h2>India, Nepal and Niger all show mean annual exposure to PM2.5 above 80 in 2019, nearly double the global average</h2>
